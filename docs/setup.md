# Setup

How to put a Stadia Controller and the receiver on one network, what certificate the
receiver serves, how to run it and how to read what it logs.

## The reference rig

```
 Internet ── router (192.168.1.1) ── Ethernet ── Mac (192.168.2.1 on bridge100) ~~ Wi-Fi hotspot ~~ controller (192.168.2.2)
```

The Mac shares its Ethernet connection over Wi-Fi (System Settings → General → Sharing →
Internet Sharing). macOS hands out `192.168.2.x` addresses on `bridge100`, with the Mac as
gateway and DNS server. The receiver runs on the Mac, spawns the DNS sink on port 53 and the
SNTP server on port 123, and listens on 443, 80 and 8008 (HTTPS and plaintext HTTP) plus UDP
40000 and 40001 for the two WebRTC sessions.

Every number above is a default of `tools/start_receiver.sh` and of `stadiacast`; see
`.env.example` and `stadiacast --help` to change them.

## Network

The only hard requirement is that **the controller resolves names through the receiver**.
The firmware looks up `*.googleapis.com`, `clients3.google.com`, `connectivitycheck.gstatic.com`,
`update.googleapis.com`, `play.googleapis.com` and `time.google.com`; the DNS sink answers the
redirected names with the receiver's IP (A records; AAAA gets an empty answer so the firmware
stays on IPv4) and forwards everything else to the real resolver (`--dns-upstream`).

Options, from simplest to most involved:

- **Hotspot hosted by the receiver's machine** (the reference rig). The machine is the
  controller's DNS server automatically.
- **Your existing Wi-Fi.** Make the router's DHCP hand out the receiver's IP as the DNS
  server for the controller (a static lease / per-client DNS option), or for the whole LAN:
  the DNS sink forwards every other name upstream, so the rest of the network keeps working.
- **Standalone DNS sink.** `python -m stadiacast.helpers.dns_sink --upstream <router>
  --redirect-ip <receiver> --log dns.jsonl` runs it without the receiver, for example on a
  different host.

Caveat: when a redirected name gets NXDOMAIN the firmware falls back to `8.8.8.8` and reaches
the real host through the NAT, which is why `--clearcut-block tls` (fail the TLS handshake)
is preferred over `--clearcut-block dns` (see [protocol.md](protocol.md#7-clearcut-and-the-power-off)).

Ports used by the receiver (all configurable):

| port | protocol | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 53 TCP/UDP | DNS | the DNS sink (`--dns-upstream` spawns it) |
| 123 UDP | SNTP | time for the controller (`--sntp`, on in the `live` preset) |
| 443 TCP | HTTPS | every Google endpoint the firmware talks to |
| 80, 8008 TCP | HTTP | the local control endpoints `/_status`, `/_rumble`, `/_start_game`, `/_audio` |
| 40000 UDP | STUN/DTLS | the display link of the first controller (`c0`) |
| 40001 UDP | STUN/DTLS | the game-streaming session of the first controller |
| 40002, 40003 UDP, ... | STUN/DTLS | the same pair for the second controller (`c1`), and so on: base port + 2 per controller |

On Linux, binding the ports below 1024 needs root, or `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` granted to the
interpreter binary (`setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep` on the file `.venv/bin/python3` links to).

On Windows, the Windows Time service holds UDP 123 while it runs, and the SNTP server cannot
start until it is stopped: `Stop-Service w32time` in an administrator PowerShell (Windows
starts it again at the next boot).

On Windows, when the controller sits on another subnet than the PC (a dedicated Wi-Fi network
routed to it), Windows Defender Firewall drops the inbound traffic by default: allow UDP 53,
TCP 443 and the UDP range of the WebRTC ports (40000 and up, two per controller). A blocked
game port shows as a steady white controller whose StartGame fails after a few seconds.
Users also report that the controller's Wi-Fi chip speaks WPA2 only: give the network it joins
WPA2-Personal (AES) with protected management frames off, not WPA3.

## Certificate

The firmware validates the server chain against its built-in Google Trust Services (GTS)
roots and checks nothing else: not the hostname, not the validity dates, not revocation. Any
GTS-issued chain therefore answers every Google name, and a self-signed one is rejected with
the TLS alert `unknown_ca` (the tests use one anyway, `--self-signed`, because the fake
controller does not check).

**The built-in certificate.** With none configured, the receiver serves a GTS chain issued for
a domain dedicated to the project and revoked, with reason key compromise, before its key was
published: exactly enough for the controller and useless anywhere else. The log records a
`builtin_credential` event with its subject, issuer and serial.

**Bringing your own.** Pass `--cert` (PEM chain, leaf first) and `--key`, or put the pair
under `certs/` as `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`; a pair there wins over the built-in one,
and a file named on the command line that does not exist is an error. Google's public CA
issues certificates for free over ACME for a domain whose DNS records you can edit. Use a
domain dedicated to the receiver, since the certificate is served for Google's names, and
issue it once: the firmware does not check the dates, so it never needs renewing.

```sh
gcloud services enable publicca.googleapis.com          # once, in any GCP project
gcloud publicca external-account-keys create             # prints keyId + b64MacKey
certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns \
    --server https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/directory \
    --email <you@example.org> --agree-tos --no-eff-email \
    --eab-kid=<keyId> --eab-hmac-key=<b64MacKey> \
    -d receiver.example.org --config-dir ./le --work-dir ./le --logs-dir ./le
```

Copy `fullchain.pem` (the full chain: the intermediate matters) and `privkey.pem`
(`chmod 600`) to `certs/`; both are ignored by git.

## Running

`tools/start_receiver.sh` starts the receiver with `--preset live`, a fresh run directory
`captures/<stamp>/` and a packet capture of the whole hotspot interface when `/dev/bpf*` is
readable (`sudo chmod o+rw /dev/bpf*` once; `PCAP=0` skips it, `PCAP_FILTER` narrows it). It
reads the rig settings from the environment or from a `.env` file at the repo root (see
`.env.example`), and passes any extra arguments on to the receiver, where they override the
preset:

```sh
tools/start_receiver.sh --start-game        # also start the game session once READY
tools/stop_receiver.sh
```

The run directory contains:

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `server.jsonl` | the event log: one JSON object per line, `ts` and `event` plus fields |
| `server.out` | the console echo of the log (one compact line per event) |
| `bodies/` | every request body the controller sent, as raw bytes |
| `dns.jsonl`, `sntp.jsonl` | the helper processes' logs |
| `bridge100.pcap` | the packet capture, when enabled |

`GET http://<receiver>/_status` returns the live state as JSON: per controller its session,
battery level, headset and headset stream (`playback`), and with `--gamepad` every virtual pad
under `gamepads`, with its XInput `slot` or the `error` its creation ended in. `-v` echoes the
bulky log fields (request bodies, decoded protobufs) to the console too.

`/_audio` controls the headset stream while the receiver runs: `GET` shows it, and a `POST`
names an action, `{"do": "start", "source": "system"}` (optionally with `volume` and
`application`), `{"do": "stop"}`, `{"do": "volume", "volume": 0.5}` or
`{"do": "mode", "mode": 2}`. With several controllers, `controller` names the target, as
for `/_rumble`.

### Waking the controller

Press the Stadia button for about one second and release at the first vibration. A full boot
takes roughly ten seconds: the light blinks while the controller joins the Wi-Fi and talks to
the receiver, then **two short rumbles and a steady light** mean it matched. Wakes alternate
between full boots and short *report wakes* (a blinking light, no rumble, a Clearcut upload
and back to sleep): press again. A 4 s hold of the Stadia button powers the controller off.

### Several controllers

Every controller that identifies itself gets its own session: the label `c0`, `c1`, ... on
every log line and in `/_status`, its own pair of UDP ports (see the table above), its own
DTLS certificates and GMsg queue. Controllers are told apart by the ids the firmware sends
(`controller-device-id` / `controller-cloud-device-id` headers, the `device_id` in request
bodies) and by the display token the receiver hands each of them, which the firmware echoes in
its GMsg polls; the address is the fallback. A controller that reboots keeps its label.

The control endpoints take the target when more than one controller is known:

```sh
curl http://192.168.2.1/_status | jq '.controllers | map_values({device_id, ip, display: .session.display.state})'
curl -d '{"left":40000,"right":40000,"ms":1500}' 'http://192.168.2.1/_rumble?controller=c1'
curl -d '{"left":0,"right":0,"controller":"c1"}' http://192.168.2.1/_rumble
```

`stadiacast-show-input` prints one section per controller.

### Reading the logs

```sh
stadiacast-show-input captures/<stamp>                       # every button press in order, axis ranges
jq -c 'select(.event=="input")' captures/<stamp>/server.jsonl
jq -c 'select(.event|test("rpc_|display_|game_"))' captures/<stamp>/server.jsonl
```

Events worth knowing when something does not work:

| event | meaning |
|---|---|
| `tls_handshake_failed` with `UNKNOWN_CA` | the controller rejected the certificate: not a GTS chain, or the key does not match |
| no `tcp_accept` at all | the controller is not resolving names through the receiver (check `dns.jsonl`) |
| `gmsg_unattributed` | a `/gmsg` poll from a controller that never registered with this receiver process (it will register on its next boot) |
| `http_request` to `/log/batch` then silence | the Clearcut power-off; make sure the `live` preset (`clearcut_block=tls`) is active |
| `display_rpc_unanswered` | the controller never answered `GetControllerStateRequest`; see protocol.md on the ResolveDiscovery trigger |
| `rpc_out_failed` | an RPC was attempted without a DTLS session |
| `game_start_failed` | the controller refused `StartGame` (it was not in BROWSE) |
| `rumble_refresh_failed` | the game session dropped while a rumble was held |
| `audio_start_failed` | the `--audio-source` stream could not start (`spec` is the source, `error` says why): no ffmpeg with libopus on `PATH`, or the source was refused |
| `audio_source_invalid` | the `--audio-source` spelling is wrong, or the capture it names cannot be set up on this machine (no loopback device, missing extra) |
| `audio_capture`, `audio_capture_failed`, `audio_capture_ended` | the capture feeding ffmpeg (`system`, `device:`) started, could not start, or stopped (`error` says why); after a failure ffmpeg exits (`audio_ffmpeg_exited`) and both start again, until the stream is stopped |
| `gamepad_created`, `gamepad_failed` | `--gamepad`: a controller's virtual pad exists (`slot` is its XInput player), or could not be created (`error`, shown under `gamepads` in `/_status` too); the controller's next boot tries again |
| `gamepad_rumble_failed` | the game's rumble could not be forwarded (the game session was not up) |
| `controller_hardware` | one line at READY with what the controller says about itself: product, hardware and firmware builds, serial, headset |
| `controller_battery` | the battery gauge moved (`percent`); it steps down one percent at a time |
| `controller_audio_config` | the headset was plugged in or pulled (`headset`) |
| `port_busy` | port 80 or 8008 is held by another program; the receiver goes on without it, 443 is the only port the controller needs |
| `helper_exited` | the DNS sink or the SNTP server (`helper`) ended; `output` holds the last lines it wrote, which name the port another program holds |

## Wi-Fi provisioning over Bluetooth

A controller that has never been set up (or was factory reset) advertises a Bluetooth LE
setup service and waits for Wi-Fi credentials: its status light blinks orange. If it does
not, hold the Options (⋯) and Google Assistant buttons together until it does.
`stadiacast-provision` then sends the credentials the way the Stadia app did:

```sh
stadiacast-provision scan                                 # find the controller (Fast Pair 0xFE2C)
stadiacast-provision provision --address <ADDR> --ssid <SSID>      # prompts for the password
```

The tool reads the controller's RSA public key, has the controller scan for Wi-Fi networks
and copies the security parameters it reports for yours, then writes the credentials with the
password encrypted under that key. The BLE link dropping right after the write is normal: the
controller leaves setup mode.

Some controllers drop the BLE link a few seconds after that Wi-Fi scan, before the credentials
are written: the tool then stops with a Bluetooth error after `STATE -> 0x16 (scan/netcheck
done)`. Run it again with `--skip-scan` and give your network's security yourself,
`--wpa-auth 7 --wpa-cipher 4` for WPA2-Personal (AES) or `1` and `1` for an open network. The
controller then finds the network by itself.

**What to expect on the first boot** (seen live on firmware `ota.282115`): the controller joins
the Wi-Fi, blinks white, resolves the Google names through the receiver and registers with it
(`controller_new` in the log), but a controller that has never been linked stops there. It
registers a second time, then idles (pinging the gateway every two seconds) until it powers
itself off after a few minutes. Wake it again: the second boot takes the normal autolinking
path and connects (two short rumbles, steady white). No link code has to be typed.

On macOS, Bluetooth addresses are CoreBluetooth UUIDs that can change between runs; `--service-data-match HEX` accepts the device by a fragment of its Fast Pair service data
instead (shown by `scan`). The password can also come from the `STADIA_WIFI_PW` environment
variable. `list-services` and `windows` dump the GATT table and the device's JSON windows for
debugging.
